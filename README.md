DONE TASKS
    Chickens will spawn in WHEN you press any key on your keyboard, each key press is 1 new chicken
    When tapping for longer durations, a chicken multiplier starts, sending extra chickens. For example, say the player has been tapping for 10s straight and has done a total of 200 key presses, they should have a multiplier of 1.1. If they maintain this rate, at 60 seconds, they should have a multiplier of 1.6x chickens spawned. *Note you may need to use some randomness to determine if a chicken should be spawned.
    Chickens will walk to the shed (This can be just straight across, nothing fancy, you don't need to have many sheds, but you do need many chickens)
    WHEN a chicken enters the shed, the total number of chickens will increase, and so should profit over time.
    When a chicken spawns, there's a small chance for an evil one to spawn, you may choose what the evil one looks like
    If there are no remaining chickens, evil ones will leave the map and despawn.
SEMI DONE TASKS
    Evil Ones will chase and devour any chickens it reaches
